My theory is that a knight can cover every space on a chessboard in just 63 moves, 
as long as it visits each sqaure only once. The Windows application I developed
should be able to prove this is true no matter what the initial position of the
knight may be. You can change the square the knight starts in by clicking on any
spot on the chessboard, and then begin the Knight's tour by pressing the "Begin
Knight's Tour" button. After the process is finished, clicking "Reset Board" will
clear the chessboard and allow you to start the tour again.
