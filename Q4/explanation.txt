Ok, first off, I would like to say that I am NOT an artist. This drawing is 
actually very impressive given my ability. Anyway, this picture represents my life
as a First Person Shooter. Each character represents a word from the phrase 
"Code Foo Challenge." Obviously, the "Challenge" is represented by the infamous
Sharktopus mentioned numerous times in IGN's Gamescoop podcast - this signifies my passion
for IGN.com, which I frequent on a daily basis. Also, you may have noticed that I
am wearing a Power Glove from the NES days, signifying my love of videogames.
Basically, the message I'm trying to get across is that I confront challenges 
head on and I refuse to give up. I only stop when I am satisfied with the outcome.
